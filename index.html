							<h1>Brianna Saylor</h1>
							<p class="major">I am an early career professional passionate about avian ecology and conservation, especially in understanding habitat selection, movement patterns, and drivers of species occurrence. My field experience includes a variety of techniques for monitoring wildlife and sampling vegetation. Through my academic projects, I have developed skills in data analysis, R coding, and mapping, which have helped me explore patterns in species diversity and habitat relationships. This portfolio highlights my academic journey and research experience. Looking ahead, I hope to continue building on these experiences and contribute to effective conservation outcomes. </p>

				<!-- Field Experience -->
					<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="first">
						<div class="content">
							<h2>Field Experience</h2>
							<p>I have experience with a wide range of field techniques including point count surveys, radio telemetry, mist-netting, vegetation sampling, autonomous recording unit deployment and maintenance, as well as backroad navigation in remote areas. My fieldwork has encompassed projects focused on habitat selection, movement ecology, nesting ecology, and ecosystem restoration. In addition to fieldwork, I have served as a data manager on multiple projects ensuring proper organization and accurate data entry throughout each study.</p>

							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>The objective of my master’s thesis is to identify the factors that influence the diversity of disturbance-dependent species in Tennessee. Specifically, my research focuses on: (1) exporing which habitat characteristics shape overall species richness, and (2) assessing which habitat features influence the occurrence of species of high conservation concern. I presented an initial overview of the species detected during surveys at the American Field Ornithologists Conference and expect to complete the full study in 2026.</p>

							<h2>Data Visualization and Analysis</h2>
							<p>My coursework has given me a strong foundation in coding and data analysis. I regularly use R to work with statistical modeling, data visualization, and spatial analysis. I also have experience coding in HTML and JavaScript for building web-based tools and visualizations. In addition to programming skills, I have used ArcGIS and Google Earth Engine for spatial analyses, mapping, and remote-sensing applications.</p>

							<h2>Soft Skills</h2>
							<p>I have strong communication skills shaped by my experience leading educational outreach and teaching audiences of all ages. I am also able to communicate in Spanish when needed. In the field I am highly adaptable and able to adjust plans in response to weather or animal behavior. My work in coding and data anlysis is enhanced by strong pattern recognition abilities and a keen attention to detail.</p>
